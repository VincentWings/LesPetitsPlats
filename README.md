# Les Petits Plats - Recipe Search Website

https://vincentwings.github.io/LesPetitsPlats/

### Project Overview
This project was developed for "Les Petits Plats," a company transitioning from publishing cookbooks to creating its own recipe website, similar to platforms like Marmiton or 750g.

The primary goal was to build a high-performance search functionality that provides a seamless user experience for finding recipes among 50 sample dishes.

### Features
- **Recipe Search Engine**: Two algorithmic implementations using native loops and functional array methods.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI adhering strictly to the provided Figma mockups.
- **Tag-Based Filtering**: Search results can be refined using recipe tags.
- **Performance Comparison**: Implemented and compared two search algorithms for optimal performance.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend Framework**: HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap CSS for styling only)
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Custom search algorithms and dynamic DOM manipulation.
- **Design Tools**: Figma for UI prototyping, Draw.io for flowchart creation.

### Development Process

1. **UI Implementation**: Built the frontend using best practices, ensuring W3C validation.
2. **Algorithm Development**: Created two search algorithm versions:
   - Native Loops (`for`, `while`) implementation.
   - Functional Array Methods (`filter`, `map`, `reduce`) implementation.
3. **Performance Testing**: Compared algorithm performance using [Jsben.ch](https://jsben.ch/OPLjw).
4. **Documentation**: Delivered a comprehensive functionality investigation document with implementation details, flowcharts, performance tests, and recommendations.

### Key Takeaways
- Emphasized code reusability and maintainability through modular functions.
- Followed Green Code practices for efficiency and security.
- Ensured a seamless, near-instantaneous search experience for end users.
